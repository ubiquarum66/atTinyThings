## Mechanical Wave Game

played by avoiding to touch the bent wiring with a electrode by controling speed, direction of a car and angle of a lever.
The lever carrying a tip electrode ring connected to a buzzer.

## Boat Pump and Thunderstorm

a small diorama, made as a present;

shows a ship before a thunderstorm roughed sea, in danger to hit a mechanical component out of steel.
The captain is holding a laptop "Big Data" and sweeps from one side to the other, in the desperate attempt 
to find some clues in the binary fata morgana.
The position lamps of the ship morse a message, the light house in the background blinks.
